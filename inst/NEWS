CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
-------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS
    o survGroup - Predict genes/genesets associated with survival. Issue: #396

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL IMPROVEMENT
    o Signature analysis has been modified to be more flexible. It now consits of three functions namely:
        o `estimateSignatures` - which measures cophenetic correlation metric (a measure of goodness of fit) for a range of values
        o `plotCophenetic` - which draws an elbow plot of cophenetic correlation metric from `estimateSignatures` and helps to decide an optimal number of signature `(n)`.
        o `extractSignatures` - which then extracts final `n` signatures
    o `compareSignatures` now has two databases of known signatures. Classic 30 signatures and newer 67 SBS signatures from COSMIC.
    o `findPathways` argument in `somaticInteractions` function has been deprecated

BUG FIX
    o gisticChromPlot bug fix. Issue: #392
    o annovarToMaf bug fix for results without exonic variants. Issue: #388
    o Avoid conflict with plotly::layout with graphcis::layout. Issue: #387
    o Fix side-bar heights in Oncoplot with copy-number data. Issue: #383
    o Update y-axis label for tcgaCompare plot. Issue: #366
    o annovarToMaf annotating variants with MNPs. Issue: #335
